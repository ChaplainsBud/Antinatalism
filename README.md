If having children during a pandemic results in their having
congenital defects, and consequently, makes it unethical, 
what about having children during a parents poor diet, exercise,
or lifestyle choices -- unprotected sex, anger mismanagement,
smoking, drinking, and so on? 

What level of fitness should a parent have before it becomes ethical to have children?

Furthermore, pandemic aside, how about other circumstances, such
as political stability and economic security? 

Should parents have children during a civil war? 

Should parents have children during a Great Depression or Recession? 

Is having children about a parent's happiness, the happiness of 
a child, or the good of something greater -- such as God, society,
and Nature? 

Shouldn't this then require even more of a parent, not merely 
mental and physical health, wealth, social network, but also a 
proper education and level of moral maturity? 

Wouldn't this also require that the parent consider the type of
person they are creating, as well as the skills they will instill,
considering what is most needed in their time/place? 

To have a child, it seems one must consider significantly more
than merely the desire to make love with someone -- and then 
take care of the accident, be it with the help of the state or one's own will to juggle three jobs simultaneously. 

It seems to require more than, "Do I want a child," to ,"Would 
my child want me," and ,"Would society want my child?" It may
seem obvious in all cases that God would want a child, but can
we say God desires... a child to be born in the worst of conditions, both internally and externally, as well as socially,
in a place where they are a burden to themselves, as much as to
others? A loving God who plans the world and intervenes in Providence seems to be One who wants parents at least to think 
ahead and consider the optimal for the most vulnerable among us,
children.
